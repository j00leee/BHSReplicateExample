					Dear Parents and Guardians:
					Nothing matters to us more than the safety of your child.
					Bayside High School is instituting a new policy for all students to keep our learning environment safe and secure for all students and staff.  It is now required that students swipe-out at the end of their day by the Auditorium Lobby Exit which leads to 32nd Avenue or the Main Entrance which leads to Corporal Kennedy Street. 
					Students swipe –in early in the morning and the time is recorded by computer. Upon exiting the building students will once again swipe-out and the computer will record their departure time.
